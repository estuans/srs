Sun Ray Server

I used the scripts and package files here to successfully install SRS 5.2 on Ubuntu Linux 11.04 i386. Hopefully this can help someone, as when setting this up I ran into issues with broken links due to the age of the software and what it requires.

I used a combination of these tutorials and reference materials to get the system installed:
* http://wiki.sun-rays.org/index.php/SRS_5.2_on_Ubuntu_11.04_(i386,_amd64)
* https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuOnSunRay
* http://wiki.sun-rays.org/index.php/SRSS_4.1_(part_of_SRS4_10/08)_on_Debian/unstable
* http://wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~simigern/sunray-debian/
* http://www.nico-maas.de/wordpress/?p=216
* Various messages on the SunRay-Users mailing list: http://www.filibeto.org/pipermail/sunray-users/
* Google is your friend!

I would recommend staying on Ubuntu 11.04 and GDM 2.20, as I haven't heard of any successful installs on later versions.
